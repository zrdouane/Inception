## Choosing the Right Version

- **Use Version 1** if you are working with legacy applications that do not require advanced features.
- **Use Version 2.x** if you need basic network and volume definitions and are not using Docker Swarm.
- **Use Version 3.x** if you are deploying applications in a Docker Swarm cluster or need advanced deployment features.
